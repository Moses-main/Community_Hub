Context
You are continuing work on an existing production-grade Church Management & Engagement Platform already started in this Replit project.
The landing page and some features exist, but admin authentication and admin-only dashboards are missing or incomplete.

Your task
Read the current codebase carefully.
Identify implemented vs missing features.
Continue building the platform without breaking existing functionality.

🔐 AUTHENTICATION & AUTHORIZATION (PRIORITY)

Implement secure authentication using Node.js + Express + JavaScript:

Email + password login

Password hashing (bcrypt)

JWT-based auth

Role-based access control:

admin

leader

member

Required endpoints

POST /auth/register (admin can create leaders/admins)

POST /auth/login

GET /auth/me

Middleware

requireAuth

requireAdmin

🧭 ADMIN DASHBOARD (REQUIRED)

Create a protected admin dashboard accessible only by admins:

Admin login page

Admin sidebar navigation

Overview metrics (members, donations, events, sermons)

Admin can:

Manage members

Manage branding/theme

View analytics

Manage events

Manage sermons & music

View donations

🗂 DATABASE

Use the existing database setup (Supabase/Postgres or Mongo if already configured).
Create missing schemas/tables only if they do not already exist.

⚙️ CONTINUE FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION

Implement only missing features from the platform specification below.
If a feature exists partially, complete it.

🛡 SECURITY REQUIREMENTS

Validate all inputs

Protect admin routes

Rate limit auth & donation routes

Use environment variables for secrets

Secure media access (signed URLs)

📁 CODE QUALITY

Plain JavaScript (no TypeScript)

Clean folder structure

Services separated from routes

Reusable middleware

FINAL INSTRUCTION

Work incrementally:

Implement authentication

Add admin dashboard access

Fill in missing platform features

Ensure everything is production-ready

Do NOT generate dummy data.
Do NOT remove existing UI.
Extend what exists.
